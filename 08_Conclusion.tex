\section*{Chapter summary}

In this chapter I will introduce my research, which will lead to the main research question and the subsequent question that will assist to answer the main research question. Further an outline of the thesis will be conducted. This chapter then concludes with the overall contribution the reader can expect from reading this thesis.\newpage

Overall, we have laid out the foundation for creating a research and design agenda towards the ecological implications of MAIs in the urban setting. 

This agenda points towards aims of actively involving citizens, and raising awareness amongst architects, urban designers, interaction designers and media artists of spatial properties when designing permanent interactive installations that serve the production of social space
