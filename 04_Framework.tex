\chapter{A framework for Media Architectural Interfaces (MAIs)}
\label{chapterlabel4}

\section*{Chapter summary}

In this chapter, I develop an interaction framework that outlines the requirements for media architecture to become accessible and interactive for building occupants and urban space inhabitants. The socio-spatial framework will be supported by a taxonomy that itemizes existing projects. Being aware of the framework will help architects, designers and stakeholders clarify the nature of interaction they want to design for.

\section{ Media Architectural Interfaces (MAI) }

%The terms Ad-hoc frameworks vs observational frameworks need to be researched again:
%Michelis, D., & Müller, J. (2011). The Audience Funnel: Observations of Gesture Based Interaction With Multiple Large Displays in a City Center. International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 27(6), 562–579. doi:10.1080/10447318.2011.555299

A design framework provides an essential structure including a set of requirements to assist third parties to advance in the area of the proposed framework.
The area of this interaction design framework is concerned with design aspects in the context of the socio-spatial configurations in the light of interactive media architectures. 
The validity of the proposed framework will be tested in two stages: 
Firstly, a taxonomy of existing projects will be provided and secondly, through a series of case studies the requirements will be confirmed. 

Exploring the design requirements in relation with the socio-spatial aspects when designing for interactions with media architecture is the aim of this dissertation. 
Hence, it is vital to study the design and usage of existing large electronic surfaces in divers public spaces including space inhabitants acting within on their own agenda.
Through these studies frameworks derive which assist others when designing, building and evaluating interactive systems in everyday life. 
The proposed framework is based on the background research. 

From considering the different types of socio-spatial interaction frameworks in section 2.3, I unfold a particular form of interactive system (media architectural) that enables engagement with space inhabitants. 

The following framework draws on the definitions introduced in my background review in the previous chapter: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Socio-spatial configurations} \index{socio-spatial configurations} - 
The triangular relationship between a given Spatial Layout, the Attractor and Movement and their interdependent properties are defined as in this dissertation as socio-spatial configurations. In other words these configurations describe the dynamic interplay of performers and their roles in between different interaction zones (following the urban HCI framework).
\item \textbf{Interfaces} \index{interfaces} -  
In this dissertation the notion of interfaces goes beyond the mere definition of digital devices that mediate human interactions. Here interfaces are defined as processes, where a set of interconnected activities are performed by humans within time and space, that not only include interactions between humans and technology but consider given socio-spatial configurations. 
\end{itemize}

Further the framework is based on a conceptional framework by Hillier. The essential structure consists of Attractor, Spatial Layout and Movement.

%In general, Media Architectural Interfaces (MAI) describe an ecology of tangible and non-tangible interfaces in a given socio-spatial context.
%They can be considered as interactive systems in urban space, which potentially entice people to step out of their habitual routine and perceive urban space through a new lens or act differently within it. 

I consider Media Architectural Interfaces (MAI) as the synthesis of situated and shared or mobile and individual technology \textit{Mediator}, which mediates participants’ engagement with large programmable electronic \textit{Surfaces} attached or incorporated into \textit{Carriers} in a given socio-spatial \textit{Context}.
Surface/Carriers can be Urban Screens, Media Facades or Media Architecture.
Where the level of integration divers from standalone surfaces (i.e. Urban Screens) to attached or retrofitted (i.e. Media Facades) to incorporated (i.e. Media Architecture).

The essential structure consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mediator}  can be tangible or non-tangible interfaces are generally located on street level, 

Mediator, Surface and Content (i.e. Attractor) may disrupt movement and behavioural patterns in the given spatial setting (i.e. \textit{Context}).

\item \textbf{Surface} either call for explicit and shared interactions or implicit and individual interactions.

\item \textbf{Context} 

\end{itemize}

The requirements for that underlay the structure are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Interaction modalities}  xxx

\item \textbf{Form factors} xxx

\item \textbf{Interaction zones} xxx 

\item \textbf{Human behaviour} xxx

\end{itemize}


Here needs to come what has been described already in too much detail in the previous section:

\section{Taxonomy of Media Architectural Interfaces}

I will now introduce a taxonomy to illustrate the MAI framework with a serious of projects. 

Hence the relevant information has been plotted to gain a better understanding of the relation between the individual properties concerned with different electronic surfaces (\label{fig:CCN_Taxonomy}).

Large electronic surfaces amplify participants’ interactions through the tangible interfaces, which depend on technical properties of these surfaces such as type, shape, material, size and resolution of the surface. Both interfaces (tangible and non-tangible) are dependent on the given socio-spatial setting, for example on pedestrianised places, busy high streets or transport hubs. 
As a consequence, the distance between the tangible interface and the display can vary. 
Furthermore, when changing the properties within one of the three constituent elements (Surface, Interface or Context) the two other elements are directly affected. 

The properties of each constituent element are described in the following: Regarding the Interface, the characteristics for the \textit{level of participation} have been described by Fritsch and Brynskov as \textit{static, dynamic, reactive, interactive, participatory,} and \textit{communicative} and recently extended by Caldwell and Foth who added the terms \textit{performative} and \textit{controllable}.
The characteristics of the \textit{interaction modalities} originates from dimensions summarised by Müller et al. and uses the following interaction modalities: \textit{presence, body position, body posture, facial expression, gaze, speech, gestures, remote control, keys, touch} . 
This may also impact the distance between the Interface and the Surface. 
Being aware of these properties and their characteristics will help designers clarify the nature of interaction they want to design for.
The properties concerned with the Surface are mostly related to the technical details of large electronic surfaces, as described by Halskov and Ebsen.
They consist of \textit{type, material, shape, size} and \textit{resolution} but also of the \textit{type of content}. 
Each of these characteristics can impact the multi-layered spatial frameworks described above (i.e. Awareness Spaces, Actor Spaces, Action Spaces, Physical Spaces).
The Context refers to an understanding of the socio-spatial settings that are core properties, when locating a MAI. 
There is a huge difference when designing in the context of a pedestrianised court in the city (i.e. Medialab-Prado or Ars Electronica Center) or a busy high street such as the SESI Digital Gallery in São Paulo.
Although most of the characteristics aligned in the taxonomy describe the properties of the constituent elements (i.e. Surface, Interface, Context) from a technical point of view, they influence the multi-layered spatial frameworks (i.e. Awareness Spaces, Actor Spaces, Action Spaces, Physical Spaces) and consequently the MAI design space for interactions in the urban setting. 

In summary, it appears that the affordance of each of the described spaces has a strong impact on the presented studies and therefore need to be taken into account when designing for such interactive systems in the built environment. 
With this in mind, we return to our initial question: How to actually go about designing for an interaction with MAI? 
To help answering this question, we now introduce a taxonomy for the categorisation of MAI based on the triangular relationship between TUI, display and setting. 
We have plotted the relevant information of both design studies against each other to gain a better understanding of the relation between the individual properties.
In more detail, the properties of each constituent element will be described below:
\textbf{Interface: }The characteristics for the participation level have been described by Fritsch and Brynskov (2011) as (1) static, (2) dynamic, (3) reactive, (4) interactive, (5) participatory and (6) communicative and recently have been extended by Caldwell and Foth (2014), who added the terms (7) performative and (8) controllable.
The characteristics of the interaction modalities originate from dimensions summarised by Müller et al. (2010) and use the following interaction modalities:
(1) presence, (2) body position, (3) body posture, (4) facial expression, (5) gaze, (6) speech, (7) gestures, (8) remote control, (9) keys and (10) touch. 
This may also impact the distance between the interface and the display. 
Being aware of these properties and their characteristics will allow designers clarifying the nature of interaction they want to design for.
\textbf{Display: }These properties are mostly related to the technical details of large programmable displays as described by Halskov and Ebsen (2013). They consist of (1) type, (2) material, (3) shape, (4) size and (5) resolution but also of (6) the type of content. Each of these characteristics can impact the multilayered spatial frameworks described above (i.e. awareness, action, actor, physical).
\textbf{Context: }Understanding the socio-spatial settings as described in Sect. 2.1 are core properties when locating a MAI. As explained in this paper, here is a huge difference when designing in the context of a pedestrianised university court (i.e. VEIV London) or a busy high street (i.e. SCSD Sao Paulo).
Although most of the characteristics aligned in our taxonomy describe the properties of the constituent elements (i.e. display, interface, context) from a technical point of view, they influence the multilayered spatial frameworks (i.e. awareness, actor, action, physical) and consequently assist when designing MAI for interactions in urban space. 
Through understanding the effect of the single properties of each constituent element on the whole interactive system, designers may eventually be able to be fully aware of their design decisions.

In this chapter, we have introduced the notion of Media Architectural Interfaces (MAI) and highlighted its socio-spatial implications when designing interactive systems in urban space. In order to support this framework we displayed relevant projects in a taxonomy. 
Through understanding the effect of the single properties of each constituent element on the whole interactive system stakeholders, curators, artists, designers and architects may eventually be more aware of their design decisions and their implications.
